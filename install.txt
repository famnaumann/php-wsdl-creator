To install the demonstrations on your webserver, simply copy all files to a 
folder that is accessable with a browser. To see the generated WSDL, you 
don't need to do anything else.

The caching feature also needs a writeable cache folder. Per default the demo 
classes are using the subfolder "cache". Set the rights for this folder to 
777. You really should use caching! Disabling the cache makes only sense in 
some special cases. However, PhpWsdl will also work with caching disabled.

To see the WSDL in your browser, the location should look like this:

http://your-server.com/demo.php?WSDL&readable

This location is also valid when adding a service or web reference in 
Microsoft Visual Studio for example. Within the WSDL the real SOAP endpoint 
(without "?WSDL") is defined. But for your project you should use the 
optimized WSDL URI:

http://your-server.com/demo.php?WSDL

To see a human readable HTML interface description, simply use this location:

http://your-server.com/demo.php

Demos 1-3 should produce equal and valid WSDL. If something doesn't work, 
be sure that your PHP installation includes the PHP SoapServer class! To 
determine this, you can use this PHP script:

<?php phpInfo();

The output should contain "Soap Server enabled" in the "soap" section. The 
rest is done in standard PHP and shouldn't have any special requirements. I 
developed and tested PhpWsdl with PHP 5.2.10 on a Debian lenny server. But 
PhpWsdl may also work on a different OS and with older or newer PHP versions.
