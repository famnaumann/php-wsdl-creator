Bugfix: Extension loading failed because the generated filename didn't match
Bugfix: PhpWsdl::Init method was called too late
Changed: Some code from the PhpWsdl::Init method that is related to other 
         classes is now replaced to the top of the mathing class definition
Changed: Most internal hook handlers will now return TRUE to give your own 
         handlers a chance to run
New: Started to add debugging informations
New: $class in PhpWsdl->RunServer may be an instance of an object that will 
     become provided to the PHP SoapServer by the setObject method.
New: The static PhpWsdl::CreateInstance method is the new way to create an 
     instance of PhpWsdl to be compatible to extensions.

New: The Zend adapter lets you use Zend as SOAP server
New: Proxy webservice for forwarding AJAX SOAP requests to another SOAP 
     webservice
Info: If you used the PrepareServerHook or RunServerHook, you should notice 
      the bugfix: Your handler method will now receive an hash array! Please 
      update your code to be compatible.

      bugfix: Their names have now the 'Hook' postfix!

2011-07-31: 2.0
Info: In earlier versions multiple complex types could be defined within one 
      comment block. Now every complex type has to be defined in its own 
      comment block. If multiple complex types are defined in a single 
      comment block, only the first one will be visible! This is the only 
      change in this version that affects the main usage of PhpWsdl.

2011-07-30: 1.1
Changed: Unoptimized WSDL won't be cached anymore
Changed: PhpWsdl->CreateWsdl is now PhpWsdl->ParseFiles where is makes more 
         sense
Changed: The PhpWsdl->OutputHtmlHook can now return a true value to omit the 
         internal HTML

         default
Changed: The default namespace is now generated with the server environment 
         information
Changed: PhpWsdl trys to detect the name of the class that handles the SOAP 
         requests
Changed: PhpWsdl will use the "SCRIPT_FILENAME" if CreateWsdl is called 
         without setting up the PhpWsdl->Files property
Changed: Giving only TRUE to the PhpWsdl constructor will run the SOAP server 
         by determining all configuration
New: @pw_clear keyword to initialize the parser temporaries
New: Added demo4.php to demonstrate how to use PhpWsdl in quick mode
New: PhpWsdl has a quick mode now
New: Added test URIs on my server so you can test PhpWsdl without installing 
     it on your own server
New: Added support for the HTML2PDF http API (see www.htmltopdf.de for more 
     information) to enable licensed users to generate a PDF from the 
     documentation with the WSDL files attached (in the PDF document itself)
New: Complex types and public methods are now being sorted by their names in 
     the HTML output 
New: Now there is an index in the HTML description to jump to a definition
New: The PhpWsdl->Force(Not)OutputWsdl/Html flags can enable and disable 
     sending WSDL and/or HTML
New: The options that are given to the PHP SoapServer constructor can be 
     modified with the new PhpWsdl->SoapServerOptions array
New: The HTML output can be downloaded as PDF when clicking the "Download this 
     page as PDF" at the bottom of the document. This will only work in an 
     internet environment without authentification! (See www.htmltopdf.de for 
     more information)
New: Documentation can be parsed and included in WSDL and the HTML output
New: Setting "docs" holds the documentation for elements and will be filled by 
     the file parser
New: PhpWsdl->ParseDocs flag to enable parsing for documentation (enabled per 
     default)
New: PhpWsdl->IncludeDocs flag to enable including the documentation in WSDL, 
     if the optimizer is disabled (enabled per default)
New: Version history in readme.txt
Info: Except for the change of the PhpWsdl->OutputHtmlHook behavior this 
      version is fully compatible to version 1.0. The bugfixes are released in 
      version 1.0.1, the download has been updated
Info: There are plans for great improvements for this quick shot. The whole 
      parsing engine could maybe been done with not more than only 3 regular 
      expressions at all, f.e. The parser and the WSDL builder should support 
      plugins to extend PhpWsdl very easy and compatible to future changes. 
      All this will be a version 2.0. Until that version is released, version 
      1.* will of course be continued.

2001-07-29: 1.0.1
Bugfix: When determining the endpoint URI the http(s) selection didn't work 
        for an SSL URI
Bugfix: "is_boolean" should be "is_bool". Because of this bug the server 
        was not able to run at construction time
Bugfix: Found a typo in the HTML description: "occours" should be "occurs"
Info: This version is fully compatible to version 1.0.
